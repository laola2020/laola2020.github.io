This site refers to the itinerant argentinian version of the project, **KOMBUCH.ar** in its fusion with the BIOHACK ACADEMY Programme, at the WAAG Academy in Amsterdam.  This version has received the name of KOMBUCH.ar/nl.GENOMICS.

**Kombucha Genomics Argentina**, (**KOMBUCH.ar** from now on)is the local version of the project in my country where the need of a physical space and equipment is one of the very first challenges to overcome. So the project implies to support a growibg community of bio enthusiasts, to make our own hardware using openhardware tools and working in biosafety conditions. After that the idea is to repeat the protocol, with special emphasis in the research on the kombucha leather and in the development and set of the protocol for teaching.
