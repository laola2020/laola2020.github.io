Here you will find all the documentation of "KOMBUCH.ar/nl.GENOMICS", the itinerant version of KOMBUCHA GENOMICS ARGENTINA (KOMBUCH.ar) that temporally moved to the BioHack Academy at the WAAG Society in Amsterdam, to develop all the devices based on the Open Hardware documentation during the Programme. The practices at the wetlab practices at the WetLab are also reflected here.
