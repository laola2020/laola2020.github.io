This is the BioHack Academy documentation site of "KOMBUCH.ar/nl.GENOMICS" a nomadic argentinian version of KOMBUCHA GENOMICS, a joint project between Counter Culture Labs and BioCurious. 
This nomadic version migrates temporarely to the BioHack Academy to set the necessary open hardware devices for making the project and to follow the protocol for the biomolecular study of kombucha.
As the argentinian community of biohackers working on this project is mostly working on textiles, the amazing experience of the TextileLab at the WAAG is fundamental for this project.

All the documentation and work in progress of this project will be reflected in this repository.
