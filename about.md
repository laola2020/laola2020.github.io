This is the BioHack Academy documentation site of "KOMBUCH.ar/nl.GENOMICS" a nomadic argentinian version of KOMBUCHA GENOMICS. 
This nomadic version migrates temporarely to the BioHack Academy to set the necessary open hardware devices for making the project and to follow the protocol for the biomolecular study of kombucha.
As the argentinian community of biohackers working on this project is mostly working on textiles, the amazing experience of the TextileLab at the WAAG is fundamental for this project.

The work in progress of this project will be reflected in this repository. The main page contains general Information, including comments and exchanges between the different communities working on this project. The documentation section will offer a weekly technical update of the project, including hardware, code, wetlab technics.
