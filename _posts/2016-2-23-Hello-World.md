# KOMBUCH.ar Consortium

## A communitary project associated with Kombucha Genomics

This is my first post as a user a of a github documentation page. So it is just a trial version... be patient!.

**Kombucha Genomics** is the main title of a project run by Counter Culture Lab and Biocurious and joined with several communitary labs from different countries. I will base my own artistic project on it at the Bio Hack Academy following it protocol and making my own long way around to the material aspect of kombucha leather.
