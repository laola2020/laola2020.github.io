# KOMBUCH.ar Consortium

## A communitary project associated with Kombucha Genomics

This is my first post as a user a of a github documentation page. So it is just a trial version... be patient!.

**Kombucha Genomics** is the main title of a project run by Counter Culture Lab and Biocurious and joined with several communitary labs from different countries. I will base my own artistic project on it at the Bio Hack Academy following it protocol and making my own long way around to the material aspect of kombucha leather. 

KOMBUCH.ar/nl.GENOMICS is part of KOMBUCHA GENOMICS, 
a joint project between BioCurious and Counter Culture Labs.  
As a syntesis, this project aims to isolate and identify the microorganisms 
that conforms the komobucha as well as to make trials changing growing media 
conditions in order to obtain different kombucha leather qualities and to use 
some of the isolated microorganism to make other fermented foods. it is expected 
to count on a protocol to develop the project in educational programmes, using DIY hardware.
