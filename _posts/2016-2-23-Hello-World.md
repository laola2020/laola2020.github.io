# KOMBUCH.ar/nl.GENOMICS
## A communitary project associated with *KOMBUCHA GENOMICS* a joint project between **BioCurious and Counter Culture Labs**

**KOMBUCHA GENOMICS** project aims to select, describe, isolate and identify the microorganisms that conform the kombucha *consortium* of yeast and bacteria, as well as to make variations in its fermentation medium in order to obtain different qualities in the kombucha leathers. In the roadmap, the use of some of the isolates for new fermented foods is another goal of this project. 
**KOMBUCH.ar/nl** is the itinerant expression of this project, now in The Netherlands, just after setting the project in Argentina where I live and work. As part of the 5th Biohack Academy Programme at the WAAG Society, I expect on making the open science hardware and devices, looking forward to make the project accesible for a major community and to replicate it in educational programmes.
